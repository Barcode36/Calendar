# Calendar Application
This is a calendar application that can keep appointments for gregorian dates. Appointments are kept ina csv file, the app updates itself based on the file.

## Getting Started
The initial view when starting the app is the current month view based on your local machine timestamp. The navigation buttons on the top allow you to move back and forth between months. The "today" button allows you to always return to the current month according to your machine. The "year" button provides you with a year view of all the months in current year you are viewing.

## Appointments
Appointments can be made while viewing any single month and double clicking on a date within the current month. This then prompts a pop up to display allowing you to set a title for your appointment and also set a time for the appointment.
